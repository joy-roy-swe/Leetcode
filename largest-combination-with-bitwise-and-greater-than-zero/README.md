# Problem: Largest Combination with Bitwise AND Greater Than 0

The **bitwise AND** of an array `nums` is the result of performing a bitwise AND operation across all integers in `nums`.

Given an array of positive integers `candidates`, we need to:
- Evaluate the bitwise AND of every possible combination of numbers in `candidates`.
- Return the size of the largest combination of `candidates` where the bitwise AND result is greater than 0.

Each number in `candidates` can be used only once per combination.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`candidates = [16,17,71,62,12,24,14]`

**Output:**  
`4`

**Explanation:**  
- Possible combinations with a bitwise AND > 0:
  - `[16,17,62,24]` with bitwise AND = `16`
  - `[62,12,24,14]` with bitwise AND = `8`
- The largest valid combination size is 4, so we return 4.

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`candidates = [8,8]`

**Output:**  
`2`

**Explanation:**  
- The combination `[8,8]` has a bitwise AND of `8`, which is greater than 0.
- The size of this combination is 2, so we return 2.

## Constraints

- `1 <= candidates.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= candidates[i] <= 10^7`

## Approach

1. **Understand Bitwise AND Property**: The bitwise AND of two numbers will only be greater than 0 if they share at least one common bit set to 1.
2. **Count Set Bits**: For each bit position, count how many numbers in `candidates` have that bit set to 1.
3. **Find Maximum Combination Size**: The largest combination with a bitwise AND > 0 will be the maximum count for any bit position across all numbers.

This approach avoids generating all possible combinations, focusing instead on bit-level analysis for efficiency.
